# Steven11-Car-Rentals-Web

A school project we made on the 2nd sem of our first year! using my supervision i lead my freshmen team in creating a 
car rental website with html, css, javascript, php and mysql as database. it's quite a hard one to make but i say it's 
worth it. i would like to create more website like this in the future
